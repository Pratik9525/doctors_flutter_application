# doctors_flutter_application

**SAPDOS Flutter Application**

This Flutter project, called SAPDOS, showcases an application designed for both doctors and patients. The data for both doctors and patients is passed through `YAML` files.

You can view a demo video of the SAPDOS app and some output screenshots on the GitHub repository.i.e. [screenshots_and_video](https://github.com/Pratik9525/doctors_flutter_application/tree/feature_SAPDOS_app_yaml/screenshots_and_video)

In the application, I've included a UI called the `Select ID Screen`. This screen serves to demonstrate the functionality of both the Doctor Screen and the Patient Screen. You can find the code for this UI here 
[select_id_screen](https://github.com/Pratik9525/doctors_flutter_application/blob/feature_SAPDOS_app_yaml/lib/login/screens/select_id_screen.dart )

Additionally, in the payment method, I've added two extra modes: [Cash](https://github.com/Pratik9525/doctors_flutter_application/blob/feature_SAPDOS_app_yaml/screenshots_and_video/Patient_Screen_05_04.png) and [Paypal](https://github.com/Pratik9525/doctors_flutter_application/blob/feature_SAPDOS_app_yaml/screenshots_and_video/Patient_Screen_05_03.png).

Feel free to explore the project and its features!
